For the past few months I've been wanting to start writing about some hobby projects or interesting technologies, and while I had been looking at some online platforms for writing, I decided it would be a fun project to make my own.
Now full disclosure, this website was super easy to set up because of a wonderful post by Cassidy Williams at Netlify [you can check it here, with a link to source code](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/04/building-a-markdown-blog-with-next-9.3-and-netlify/), 
so really this site was very little work for me but I just wanted to give a shoutout to her for making such an excellent guide, my source code for the site is available over [here](https://github.com/DarraghClarke/darraghclarke.github.io),
though really the blog post above is probably a much better starting point if you want explanations of how stuff works or want to build your own site with the source code.
# So whats the point of this post/blog/website
Well this post was basically just a way to introduce the site, but also to give credit to the post that made me end up making this post.
The first few posts here will cover some stuff I've been doing lately with graduating college as well as my immediate post graduation projects.
Finally this site is mostly just a repository for links to some projects, highlighting some learning, and then in rare circumstances if I learned hwo to do something that I just wish there had been an online guide for, I might give a breakdown about it here.
So yes this post is pretty much filler, but I didn't want to put the site up without a post, so here we are.
